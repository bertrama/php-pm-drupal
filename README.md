# PHP-PM HttpKernel Adapter

This is a fork of the HttpKernel adapter for use of Symfony and Laravel frameworks with PHP-PM. See https://github.com/php-pm/php-pm to provide a bootstrap & bridge for Drupal.

The code is in pre-alpha -- very experimental.

### Setup

  1. Install PHP-PM

        composer require php-pm/php-pm:dev-master

  2. Install HttpKernel Adapter

        composer require php-pm/httpkernel-adapter:dev-master
